# 🎯 Tasca S2.01 - Database Modeling with MySQL

## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This repository contains exercises for database modeling using MySQL. The tasks are divided into three levels of complexity and are designed to represent real-world scenarios from various industries and domains. Each task involves designing the structure of a relational database, defining relationships, and managing data efficiently.

### 📚 Exercises

#### Level 1:

- **Exercise 1 - Optics Management**  
  The project involves creating a database structure for an optics store named **"Cul d'Ampolla"**. The database must store information about suppliers, glasses brands, customers, and sales staff. Specific details such as customer referrals, lens details, and employee participation in sales are required.

- **Exercise 2 - Pizzeria Delivery System**  
  Design a database for a web-based food delivery application. The database must handle customers, addresses (with locality and province relationships), orders, and product details like pizzas, hamburgers, and drinks. It also includes the management of stores, employees, and delivery assignments.

#### Level 2:

- **Exercise 1 - YouTube Database Model**  
  Create a simplified model for a YouTube-like platform. It includes user data, video uploads (with likes, dislikes, and tags), channels, subscriptions, playlists, and comments. The focus is on capturing user interactions and metadata related to videos and playlists.

#### Level 3:

- **Exercise 1 - Spotify Database Model**  
  Develop a database model for Spotify. It should differentiate between free and premium users, manage playlists, songs, albums, and artists. The database will track user subscriptions, payments, and playback statistics. It also supports features like storing deleted playlists, shared playlists, and similar artist relationships.
